# What is this?
This repo is meant for Collaborative Storytelling. 
Each directory is a "Story" (in quotes, since "Story" can mean many things).

It's kinda like that game where everyone sits in a circle, and someone starts the story with a sentence. Rotating around the circle, everyone takes a turn contributing a new piece to the story.

# What do I do?

### To create a new story:
- Peruse current issues for story ideas
- Create a new directory, and name it the title of the story
- Create a new [Markdown (`.md`)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file, and name it the title of the story

Have an idea for the beginning of a Story?

Have a prompt to use for starting a Story?

Add a ticket to suggest your idea!

### To collaborate on an already-existing story:
- Fork the repo
- Make edits to a story's already-existing [Markdown (`.md`)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file. Add to the story where the last contributor left off.

# Story Guidelines
Here are some general guidelines that will help you build upon the amazing imagination of others and keep the stories going. Many of these guidelines are based off the [rules of improv](http://improvencyclopedia.org/references/5_Basic_Improv_Rules.html). Also see [Tina Fey's basics of improv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmafmRIeet0).

#### "Agree"
Agree with the content of the contributors before you. Acknowledge the world/details/relationships created by other collaborators.

> Obviously in real life, you're not always going to agree with everything everyone says, but the rule of Agreement reminds you to respect what other collaborators have created, and at least start from an open minded place. Start with a yes and see where that takes you. -- Tina Fey, _Bossypants_

#### "Yes, and..."
Agree with the content of contributors before you, _and add onto it_.

> "Yes and..." means dont be afraid to contribute. It's your respnsibility to contribute. Always make sure you're adding something to the discussion. Your initiations are worth while. -- Tiny Fey, _Bossypants_

#### "Details over generalities"
Details are more interesting, they also give future contributors great content to work with and carry forward.

#### Add images/gifs/wikipedia links/other media as necessary
Feel free to get creative :tada:
